                            <p>In 1945, John von Neumann's EDVAC report described a stored-program computer architecture, where program instructions and data share the same memory. This architecture became the template for virtually all modern computers.</p>

                            <p class="significance">Von Neumann architecture allowed computers to flexibly execute any instruction sequence, enabling the implementation of complex algorithms needed for AI. By the late 1940s, general-purpose electronic computers (ENIAC, EDVAC) could be programmed to perform logical and arithmetic operations, providing a necessary platform for running future AI programs and training models.</p>

                            <p>Claude Shannon published "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" in 1948, founding the field of information theory. He defined bits (binary digits) as the basic unit of information and quantified information entropy. Shannon showed how any message could be encoded as a sequence of bits and analyzed communication channel capacity.</p>

                            <p>Alan Turing's 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" introduced the Turing Test (originally called the "Imitation Game"), proposing that a machine could be called intelligent if its typed responses in a conversation could fool a human interrogator.

                            <p>The Dartmouth Summer Research Project of 1956, organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathan Rochester, is considered the birth of AI as a field. McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" at this workshop. Researchers discussed how every aspect of learning or intelligence could in principle be so precisely described that a machine could simulate it.</p>

                            <p>Frank Rosenblatt developed the perceptron, an algorithm inspired by neurons that learned to classify inputs. In 1957 he simulated a single-layer perceptron on an IBM 704 computer and later built custom hardware (Mark I Perceptron) by 1960 with 400 photo-sensors to recognize simple patterns. The perceptron learned via incremental weight updates to reduce classification error.</p>

This "connectionist" approach was a forerunner to modern neural networks. However, perceptrons could only learn linearly separable patterns, a limitation later highlighted by Minsky and Papert in 1969, leading to reduced funding for neural networks research.</p>

                            <p>In 1958, John McCarthy at MIT invented LISP (LISt Processing), a high-level programming language designed for AI research. Lisp introduced features like symbolic expressions, automatic memory management (garbage collection), and a recursion-friendly, homoiconic syntax, all suited for manipulating symbols and building AI programs.</p>

This was one of the first practical applications of ML and introduced the notion of self-learning systems. Samuel's work showed that rather than hand-coding all knowledge, machines could learn from data – a concept underlying modern LLM training.</p>

                            <p>A major breakthrough came with the 1986 publication of the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks. David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams (as part of the Parallel Distributed Processing project) showed how to efficiently compute gradients for each weight in a multi-layer perceptron by propagating errors backward from the output.</p>

                            <p class="significance">This overcame the training obstacle identified in 1969 and led to a flurry of research in neural networks. In their paper "Learning representations by back-propagating errors" (1986), they demonstrated that networks with hidden layers could learn internal representations for tasks like encoding XOR. Backpropagation remains the fundamental learning algorithm still used (with many enhancements) to train today's LLMs on enormous datasets using stochastic gradient descent. The 1986 PDP volumes also emphasized distributed representations – a principle directly inherited by word embeddings in neural language models.</p>

                            <h3>Transformer Architecture</h3>
                            <p>In June 2017, Vaswani et al. published "Attention Is All You Need," introducing the Transformer architecture. This model dispensed with recurrent networks entirely and relied solely on self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel. The original Transformer had ~65 million parameters in the encoder and a similar size decoder (about 110M total) and achieved state-of-the-art in English–German and English–French translation.</p>
                            <p class="key-figures">Key Figures: Ashish Vaswani, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit et al. (Google)</p>
                            <p class="significance">The significance of this cannot be overstated: Transformers are far more parallelizable than RNNs (allowing training on much more data), and the self-attention mechanism captures long-range dependencies with ease. The Transformer became the backbone of modern LLMs: virtually all large language models (GPT, BERT, etc.) use the Transformer architecture or its variants. It enabled training of unprecedentedly large models by scaling efficiently on GPUs/TPUs.</p>

                            <h3>Pretrained Language Models (ELMo, BERT, GPT)</h3>
                            <p>2018 was a transformative year for NLP, marked by the rise of pretrained LMs that could be fine-tuned for various tasks. In early 2018, Peters et al. introduced ELMo, using a deep bi-directional LSTM for context-sensitive word embeddings. In June 2018, OpenAI released GPT-1 (117M parameters), a unidirectional Transformer decoder trained on BookCorpus for next-word prediction. Late 2018 saw BERT by Google, a 12-layer Transformer encoder (110M parameters for BERT-base) trained on 3.3 billion words with masked language modeling.</p>
                            <p class="key-figures">Key Organizations: Google (BERT), OpenAI (GPT), Allen Institute (ELMo)</p>
                            <p class="significance">These models demonstrated that massive unsupervised pretraining yields "universal" language models that can be adapted to many tasks with excellent results. BERT-Large (340M parameters) showed clear scaling effects. The paradigm shifted: NLP tasks no longer required task-specific architectures; instead, one could "pretrain on general text, fine-tune on the task," which is the cornerstone of today's LLM usage. These models are direct predecessors to GPT-2, GPT-3, etc., differing mainly in scale and training data size.</p>

                            <p>The trend in 2019 was "bigger is better" for language models. In February 2019, OpenAI unveiled GPT-2 (1.5 billion parameters), trained on 8 million high-quality web pages. It generated remarkably coherent text, so convincing that OpenAI initially withheld the full model due to misuse concerns. Google released Bidirectional Transformer XL (XLNet), while NVIDIA's Megatron-LM reached 8.3 billion parameters. Google's T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) in late 2019 scaled to 11 billion parameters, treating every NLP task as a text-to-text problem.</p>

                            <p class="significance">All these efforts pointed in the same direction: more data + larger models = better language understanding. By end of 2019, the community had embraced a scaling law mindset: if you increase compute, model size, and data, you continue to get improved results. This set the stage for truly gigantic models in the next years. Additionally, models like RoBERTa by Facebook showed that BERT's performance could be significantly improved simply by training longer on more data.</p>

                            <p>In May 2020, OpenAI introduced GPT-3, a landmark in LLM development with 175 billion parameters, over 10× larger than GPT-2. It was trained on an unprecedented dataset of about 300 billion tokens from the internet, books, Wikipedia, and other sources. The context window was expanded to 2048 tokens. GPT-3 demonstrated remarkable zero-shot and few-shot learning abilities without fine-tuning.</p>

                            <p class="significance">GPT-3's release (with the paper "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners") captured public imagination due to the model's fluent output and versatility. It confirmed the scaling laws posited by Kaplan et al. (OpenAI, 2020): that performance improves log-linearly with model size, data size, and compute. Additionally in 2020, we saw Microsoft's Turing-NLG (17B) model and several other 10B+ models, showing a clear trend toward massive scale. These giant models exhibited emergent abilities – capabilities not present in smaller versions – suggesting that scale itself could lead to qualitatively different behavior.</p>

                            <p>2021 saw multiple organizations push LLM scale even further. Google built Switch-C Transformer with 1.6 trillion parameters using a Mixture-of-Experts approach. Microsoft and NVIDIA announced Megatron-Turing NLG 530B, a 530-billion parameter dense Transformer. Chinese research institutes also entered the race with the WuDao project announced in June 2021. DeepMind contributed with Gopher (280B) in late 2021. Multimodal models also emerged, with OpenAI's CLIP learning joint text-image representations and DALL-E creating images from text prompts.</p>

                            <p class="significance">These developments showed that scaling could continue through architectural innovations like Mixture-of-Experts (activating only a subset of parameters for any given input). This allowed trillion-parameter scales without proportional increases in computation. DeepMind's Chinchilla paper (March 2022, based on 2021 research) argued that many models were undertrained for their size and established a new optimal ratio between model size and training data, which has heavily influenced subsequent models.</p>

                            <p>A key focus in 2022 was making LLMs more helpful and harmless for user-facing applications. In January 2022, OpenAI released InstructGPT, which was GPT-3 fine-tuned with human feedback to better follow user instructions. They collected comparison data from human labelers, trained a reward model, and then optimized GPT-3 using reinforcement learning (specifically PPO) to produce outputs that humans preferred.</p>

                            <p class="significance">Even a 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model, after this process, was preferred to the 175B GPT-3 by users for following instructions. This showed that quality is not only about size, but also about alignment with user intent. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) became a crucial component in developing deployable AI assistants. Google's FLAN approach aggregated hundreds of tasks with instructions to fine-tune PaLM, while Anthropic introduced Constitutional AI, fine-tuning a model with a set of principles guiding its behavior.</p>
