├── index.html       # Main HTML file containing the timeline structure
├── styles.css       # Additional CSS styles beyond the embedded styles
├── script.js        # JavaScript for interactive functionality
├── history.txt      # Source content for timeline events
└── README.md        # Project documentation

## Technical Implementation

This project is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without dependencies on external libraries. Key technical features include:

- **Intersection Observer API**: For scroll-based animations
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: For responsive layout
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For theming and dark mode
- **CSS Transitions and Animations**: For interactive elements
- **JavaScript ES6+**: For interactive functionality
- **Media Queries**: For responsive design across devices
- **SVG Backgrounds**: For decorative elements

## Customization

### Adding New Events

To add new events to the timeline:

1. Locate the appropriate era section in `index.html`
2. Copy an existing timeline item structure
3. Update content with new event details
4. Add appropriate data attributes for filtering

Example timeline item structure:
```html
<div class="timeline-item fade-in" data-category="logic">
    <div class="timeline-dot"></div>
    <span class="timeline-year">1879</span>
    <div class="timeline-content">
        <span class="date">1879</span>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Event Title</h3>
            <p>Description of the event...</p>
            <p class="key-figures">Key Figures: Names of important people</p>
            <p class="significance">Significance: Why this event matters...</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Modifying Styles

- **Color Scheme**: Edit the CSS variables in the `:root` selector at the top of the styles
- **Animations**: Adjust transition speeds and effects in the CSS
- **Layout**: Modify the responsive breakpoints in the media queries

## Browser Compatibility

The timeline works best in modern browsers:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 16+
